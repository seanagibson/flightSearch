# flightSearch

FlightSearch is a remake of a group term project from my Object Oriented Programming class at Diablo Valley College. The original project was a simple mock flight reservation app that read a text file containing the sample data and utilized the Dijkstra graph search algorithm to find the best flight route.  It was written in C++ and used the Microsoft Foundation class for the UI. 

For the current FlightSearch project I used the following: 
  
  - Server-side was written with Node.js/Express 
  - Used the Mocha npm module for testing 
  - Used the Node-Dijkstra npm module for graph search 
  - Client-side was written with React 
  - Used the Bootstrap theme, Slate, thanks to bootswatch.com
  
The project is currently up and running at flightsearch.azurewebsites.net.
